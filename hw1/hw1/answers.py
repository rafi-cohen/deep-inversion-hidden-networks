**Your answer:**


It appears that the best accuracy scores were achieved using relatively low values of k (1-5), while the best score was
achieved using `k = 3`.

On the one hand, by basing its prediction on a very small subset of the sample's closest neighbors the model might tend
to overfit to the training data, which would lead to worse generalization for unseen data. On the other hand, basing
the model's prediction on a very large subset of the neighbors might introduce unwanted noise into the classification 
process and ultimately lower the model's accuracy. This would happen because in this case unrelated neighbors that are
farther away from the sample might have too much impact on the model's prediction.
